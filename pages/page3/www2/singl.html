]- [Voiceover] Hello and welcome</br>[
]</br>[
]00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.034</br>[
]to multivariable calculus.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:00:04.034 --> 00:00:05.439</br>[
]So I think I should probably start off</br>[
]</br>[
]00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:08.339</br>[
]by addressing the elephant</br>[
]in the living room here.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:09.816</br>[
]I am, sadly, not Sal,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:00:09.816 --> 00:00:11.139</br>[
]but I'm still gonna teach you some math.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:13.618</br>[
]My name is Grant.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:00:13.618 --> 00:00:14.912</br>[
]I'm pretty much a math enthusiast.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:00:14.912 --> 00:00:17.710</br>[
]I enjoy making animations</br>[
]of things when applicable,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:18.929</br>[
]and boy, is that applicable</br>[
]</br>[
]00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:21.193</br>[
]when it comes to multivariable calculus.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:00:21.193 --> 00:00:22.935</br>[
]So, the first thing we gotta get straight</br>[
]</br>[
]00:00:22.935 --> 00:00:25.640</br>[
]is what is this word multivariable</br>[
]</br>[
]00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.172</br>[
]that separates calculus, as we know it,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:00:27.172 --> 00:00:30.830</br>[
]from the new topic that</br>[
]you're about to study?</br>[
]</br>[
]00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.616</br>[
]Well, I could say it's all</br>[
]about multivariable functions,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:00:33.616 --> 00:00:35.253</br>[
]that doesn't really answer anything</br>[
]</br>[
]00:00:35.253 --> 00:00:36.774</br>[
]because what's a multivariable function?</br>[
]</br>[
]00:00:36.774 --> 00:00:39.340</br>[
]And basically, the kinds of functions</br>[
]</br>[
]00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.953</br>[
]that we're used to dealing with,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:00:40.953 --> 00:00:44.680</br>[
]in the old world, in the</br>[
]ordinary calculus world,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.373</br>[
]will have a single input,</br>[
]some kind of number</br>[
]</br>[
]00:00:47.373 --> 00:00:48.477</br>[
]as their input,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:00:48.477 --> 00:00:50.392</br>[
]and then the output is</br>[
]just a single number.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:00:50.392 --> 00:00:52.575</br>[
]And you would call this a</br>[
]single variable function.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:00:52.575 --> 00:00:56.209</br>[
]Basically because that guy</br>[
]there is the single variable.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:58.161</br>[
]So then a multivariable function</br>[
]</br>[
]00:00:58.161 --> 00:01:01.250</br>[
]is something that handles</br>[
]multiple variables.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.697</br>[
]So, you know, it's common</br>[
]to write it as x, y,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:01:03.697 --> 00:01:05.439</br>[
]it doesn't really matter</br>[
]what letters to use,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:07.749</br>[
]and it could be, you know, x, y, z,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:09.874</br>[
]x one, x two, x three,</br>[
]a whole bunch of things,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:01:09.874 --> 00:01:11.360</br>[
]but just to get started,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.310</br>[
]we often think just two variables</br>[
]</br>[
]00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.133</br>[
]and this will output</br>[
]something that depends on</br>[
]</br>[
]00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:16.889</br>[
]both of those.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:18.639</br>[
]Commonly it will output just a number,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:20.218</br>[
]so you might imagine a</br>[
]number that depends on</br>[
]</br>[
]00:01:20.218 --> 00:01:23.992</br>[
]x and y in some way,</br>[
]like, x squared plus y,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:01:23.992 --> 00:01:26.151</br>[
]but it could also output a vector, right?</br>[
]</br>[
]00:01:26.151 --> 00:01:29.160</br>[
]So you could also imagine something that's</br>[
]</br>[
]00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.500</br>[
]got multivariable input, f of x, y,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.578</br>[
]and it outputs something that also has</br>[
]</br>[
]00:01:35.578 --> 00:01:37.552</br>[
]multiple variables, like,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:01:37.552 --> 00:01:39.270</br>[
]I mean I'm just making stuff up here,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.080</br>[
]three x and, you know, two y.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.332</br>[
]And, this isn't set in stone,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:01:44.332 --> 00:01:46.039</br>[
]but the convention is to usually think</br>[
]</br>[
]00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.315</br>[
]if there's multiple numbers</br>[
]that go into the output,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:01:48.315 --> 00:01:49.452</br>[
]think of it as a vector,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:01:49.452 --> 00:01:51.438</br>[
]if there's multiple numbers</br>[
]that go into the input,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:01:51.438 --> 00:01:52.621</br>[
]just kind of write them,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:01:52.621 --> 00:01:53.951</br>[
]write them more sideways like this,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:01:53.951 --> 00:01:56.380</br>[
]and think of them as a point in space.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.311</br>[
]Because, I mean when you</br>[
]look at something like this,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:01:58.311 --> 00:02:00.435</br>[
]and you've got an x and you've got a y,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:02:00.435 --> 00:02:02.653</br>[
]you could think about those</br>[
]as two separate numbers.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:02:02.653 --> 00:02:03.837</br>[
]You know, here's your number line</br>[
]</br>[
]00:02:03.837 --> 00:02:05.730</br>[
]with the point x on it somewhere,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.168</br>[
]maybe that's five, maybe that's three,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:02:07.168 --> 00:02:08.411</br>[
]it doesn't really matter.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:02:08.411 --> 00:02:10.637</br>[
]And then you've got another number line</br>[
]</br>[
]00:02:10.637 --> 00:02:12.150</br>[
]and it's y, and you could think of them</br>[
]</br>[
]00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.520</br>[
]as separate entities.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.900</br>[
]But, it would probably be more accurate</br>[
]</br>[
]00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.396</br>[
]to call it multidimensional calculus,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:02:18.396 --> 00:02:20.977</br>[
]because, really, instead</br>[
]of thinking of, you know,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:02:20.977 --> 00:02:22.877</br>[
]x and y as separate entities,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:02:22.877 --> 00:02:24.538</br>[
]whenever you see two things like that</br>[
]</br>[
]00:02:24.538 --> 00:02:26.569</br>[
]you're gonna be thinking</br>[
]about the x y plane.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.090</br>[
]And thinking about just a single point.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.081</br>[
]And you'd think of this as a</br>[
]function that takes a point</br>[
]</br>[
]00:02:30.081 --> 00:02:31.022</br>[
]to a number,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:02:31.022 --> 00:02:32.589</br>[
]or a point to a vector.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:33.866</br>[
]And a lot of people, when they start</br>[
]</br>[
]00:02:33.866 --> 00:02:35.201</br>[
]teaching multivariable calculus,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:02:35.201 --> 00:02:36.606</br>[
]they just jump into the calculus,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:02:36.606 --> 00:02:37.546</br>[
]and there's lots of fun things,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:02:37.546 --> 00:02:39.268</br>[
]partial derivatives, gradients,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:02:39.268 --> 00:02:40.569</br>[
]good stuff that you'll learn.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:41.865</br>[
]But I think first of all,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:02:41.865 --> 00:02:43.470</br>[
]I want to spend a couple videos</br>[
]</br>[
]00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.965</br>[
]just talking about the different ways</br>[
]</br>[
]00:02:44.965 --> 00:02:47.065</br>[
]we visualize the different types</br>[
]</br>[
]00:02:47.065 --> 00:02:49.215</br>[
]of multivariable functions.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:02:49.215 --> 00:02:50.608</br>[
]So, as a sneak peak,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:02:50.608 --> 00:02:52.105</br>[
]I'm just gonna go through a couple of them</br>[
]</br>[
]00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:53.359</br>[
]really quickly right now,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:55.159</br>[
]just so you kind of whet your appetite</br>[
]</br>[
]00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:56.447</br>[
]and see what I'm getting at,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:02:56.447 --> 00:02:58.038</br>[
]but the next few videos are</br>[
]going to go through them</br>[
]</br>[
]00:02:58.038 --> 00:03:00.128</br>[
]in much, much more detail.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:03:00.128 --> 00:03:03.356</br>[
]So, first of all, graphs.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:03:03.356 --> 00:03:04.981</br>[
]When you have multivariable functions,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:03:04.981 --> 00:03:07.024</br>[
]graphs become three dimensional.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:03:07.024 --> 00:03:08.522</br>[
]But these only really apply</br>[
]to functions that have</br>[
]</br>[
]00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:10.228</br>[
]some kind of two-dimensional input,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:03:10.228 --> 00:03:11.436</br>[
]which you might think about as living</br>[
]</br>[
]00:03:11.436 --> 00:03:12.667</br>[
]on this x y plane,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:03:12.667 --> 00:03:14.180</br>[
]and a single number as their output</br>[
]</br>[
]00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.697</br>[
]and the height of the graph</br>[
]</br>[
]00:03:15.697 --> 00:03:17.589</br>[
]is gonna correspond with that output.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:19.586</br>[
]Like I said, you'll be</br>[
]able to learn much more</br>[
]</br>[
]00:03:19.586 --> 00:03:21.636</br>[
]about that in the dedicated video on it,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:03:21.636 --> 00:03:23.986</br>[
]but these functions also can be visualized</br>[
]</br>[
]00:03:23.986 --> 00:03:26.599</br>[
]just in two dimensions,</br>[
]flattening things out.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:28.978</br>[
]Where we visualize the entire input space</br>[
]</br>[
]00:03:28.978 --> 00:03:31.079</br>[
]in associated color, with each point.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.079</br>[
]So this is the kind of</br>[
]thing where you, you know,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:34.076</br>[
]you have some function</br>[
]</br>[
]00:03:34.076 --> 00:03:36.166</br>[
]that's got a two-dimensional input,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:03:36.166 --> 00:03:37.987</br>[
]that would be f of x, y,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:03:37.987 --> 00:03:39.764</br>[
]and what we're looking</br>[
]at is the x y plane,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:03:39.764 --> 00:03:41.169</br>[
]all of the input space,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:42.783</br>[
]and this output's just some number,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:03:42.783 --> 00:03:44.002</br>[
]you know, maybe it's like x squared,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:03:44.002 --> 00:03:45.406</br>[
]this particular one is an x squared,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:03:45.406 --> 00:03:46.406</br>[
]but, you know that,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:03:46.406 --> 00:03:48.633</br>[
]and maybe some complicated thing,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:03:48.633 --> 00:03:50.759</br>[
]and the color tells you roughly the size</br>[
]</br>[
]00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:52.698</br>[
]of that output, and the lines here,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:03:52.698 --> 00:03:54.207</br>[
]called contour lines,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:03:54.207 --> 00:03:58.282</br>[
]tell you which inputs all</br>[
]share a constant output value.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:03:58.282 --> 00:04:00.163</br>[
]And again, I'll go into</br>[
]much more detail there.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:04:00.163 --> 00:04:01.858</br>[
]These are really nice,</br>[
]much more convenient</br>[
]</br>[
]00:04:01.858 --> 00:04:03.117</br>[
]than three-dimensional graphs,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:04:03.117 --> 00:04:04.819</br>[
]to just sketch out.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:07.826</br>[
]Moving right along,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:04:07.826 --> 00:04:09.683</br>[
]I'm also gonna talk about surfaces</br>[
]</br>[
]00:04:09.683 --> 00:04:10.705</br>[
]in three-dimensional space.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:04:10.705 --> 00:04:11.819</br>[
]They look like graphs,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.125</br>[
]but they actually deal with</br>[
]a much different animal,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:04:14.125 --> 00:04:16.440</br>[
]that you could think of it</br>[
]as mapping two dimensions,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.158</br>[
]and I like to sort of spoosh it about.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:04:18.158 --> 00:04:20.504</br>[
]And we've got kind of a</br>[
]two-dimensional input,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:04:20.504 --> 00:04:22.965</br>[
]that somehow moves into three dimensions,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:04:22.965 --> 00:04:24.660</br>[
]and you're just looking at what the output</br>[
]</br>[
]00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.048</br>[
]of that looks like,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:04:26.048 --> 00:04:28.264</br>[
]not really caring about how it gets there.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:04:28.264 --> 00:04:31.022</br>[
]These are called parametric surfaces.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:04:31.022 --> 00:04:33.147</br>[
]Another fun one is a vector field,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:04:33.147 --> 00:04:35.504</br>[
]where every input point is associated</br>[
]</br>[
]00:04:35.504 --> 00:04:36.642</br>[
]with some kind of vector,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:04:36.642 --> 00:04:38.139</br>[
]which is the output of the function there.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:39.068</br>[
]So this would be a function</br>[
]</br>[
]00:04:39.068 --> 00:04:40.287</br>[
]with a two-dimensional input</br>[
]</br>[
]00:04:40.287 --> 00:04:41.820</br>[
]and a two-dimensional output</br>[
]</br>[
]00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.724</br>[
]'cause each of these are</br>[
]two-dimensional vectors.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:04:43.724 --> 00:04:44.943</br>[
]And the fun part with these guys</br>[
]</br>[
]00:04:44.943 --> 00:04:47.489</br>[
]is that you can just kind of,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:04:47.489 --> 00:04:49.099</br>[
]imagine a fluid flowing,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:51.188</br>[
]so here's a bunch of droplets, like water,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:04:51.188 --> 00:04:52.779</br>[
]and they kind of flow along that.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:54.300</br>[
]And that actually turns</br>[
]out to give insight</br>[
]</br>[
]00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.821</br>[
]about the underlying function.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:04:55.821 --> 00:04:57.389</br>[
]It's one of those beautiful aspects</br>[
]</br>[
]00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:58.689</br>[
]of multivariable calc.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:00.361</br>[
]And we'll get lots of exposure to that.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:05:00.361 --> 00:05:01.603</br>[
]Again, I'm just sort of zipping through</br>[
]</br>[
]00:05:01.603 --> 00:05:02.787</br>[
]to whet your appetite.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:05:02.787 --> 00:05:06.061</br>[
]Don't worry if this doesn't</br>[
]make sense immediately.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:05:06.061 --> 00:05:07.965</br>[
]And one of my all-time</br>[
]favorite ways to think about</br>[
]</br>[
]00:05:07.965 --> 00:05:11.321</br>[
]multivariable functions is</br>[
]to just take the input space,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:05:11.321 --> 00:05:14.118</br>[
]in this case, this is gonna</br>[
]be a function that inputs</br>[
]</br>[
]00:05:14.118 --> 00:05:15.332</br>[
]points in two-dimensional space,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:05:15.332 --> 00:05:17.520</br>[
]and watch them move to their output,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.622</br>[
]so, this is gonna be a</br>[
]function that also outputs</br>[
]</br>[
]00:05:19.622 --> 00:05:20.539</br>[
]in two dimensions.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:22.106</br>[
]And I'm just gonna</br>[
]watch every single point</br>[
]</br>[
]00:05:22.106 --> 00:05:24.962</br>[
]move over to where it's supposed to go.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:05:24.962 --> 00:05:27.064</br>[
]These can be kind of</br>[
]complicated to look at,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:05:27.064 --> 00:05:28.178</br>[
]or to think about at first,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:05:28.178 --> 00:05:30.198</br>[
]but as you gain a little bit of thought</br>[
]</br>[
]00:05:30.198 --> 00:05:31.220</br>[
]and exposure to them,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.822</br>[
]they're actually very nice,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:05:32.822 --> 00:05:34.889</br>[
]and it provides a beautiful connection</br>[
]</br>[
]00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:36.224</br>[
]with linear algebra.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:05:36.224 --> 00:05:37.280</br>[
]A lot of you out there,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.821</br>[
]if you're studying multivariable calculus,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:05:38.821 --> 00:05:40.880</br>[
]you either are about to</br>[
]study linear algebra,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.422</br>[
]or you just have, or maybe</br>[
]you're doing it concurrently,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:05:43.422 --> 00:05:45.767</br>[
]but understanding functions</br>[
]as transformations</br>[
]</br>[
]00:05:45.767 --> 00:05:47.846</br>[
]is gonna be a great way</br>[
]to connect those two.</br>[
]</br>[
]00:05:47.846 --> 00:05:48.867</br>[
]So with that,</br>[
]</br>[
]00:05:48.867 --> 00:05:51.758</br>[
]I'll stop jabbering through</br>[
]these topics really quickly</br>[
]</br>[
]00:05:51.758 --> 00:05:53.941</br>[
]and in the next few videos</br>[
]</br>[
]00:05:53.941 --> 00:05:55.543</br>[
]I'll actually go through them in detail</br>[
]</br>[
]00:05:55.543 --> 00:05:57.366</br>[
]and hopefully you can get a good feel</br>[
]</br>[
]00:05:57.366 --> 00:06:00.581</br>[
]for what multivariable functions</br>[
]can actually feel like.</br>[
