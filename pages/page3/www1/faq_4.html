<h2><a name="SEC48" href="index.html#TOC48">3.1 How can I make my program not echo input?</a></h2>


<blockquote>
<p>
How can I make my program not echo input, like login does when asking for
your password?
</p></blockquote>

<p>
There is an easy way, and a slightly harder way:

</p>
<p>
The easy way, is to use <code>getpass()</code>, which is probably found on
almost all Unices. It takes a string to use as a prompt. It will read up
to an <code>EOF</code> or newline and returns a pointer to a static area of
memory holding the string typed in.

</p>
<p>
The harder way is to use <code>tcgetattr()</code> and <code>tcsetattr()</code>, both
use a <code>struct termios</code> to manipulate the terminal. The following
two routines should allow echoing, and non-echoing mode.

</p>

<pre>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

#include &lt;termios.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

static struct termios stored_settings;

void echo_off(void)
{
    struct termios new_settings;
    tcgetattr(0,&amp;stored_settings);
    new_settings = stored_settings;
    new_settings.c_lflag &amp;= (~ECHO);
    tcsetattr(0,TCSANOW,&amp;new_settings);
    return;
}

void echo_on(void)
{
    tcsetattr(0,TCSANOW,&amp;stored_settings);
    return;
}
</pre>

<p>
Both routines used, are defined by the POSIX standard.

</p>


<h2><a name="SEC49" href="index.html#TOC49">3.2 How can I read single characters from the terminal?</a></h2>


<blockquote>
<p>
How can I read single characters from the terminal? My program is always
waiting for the user to press <kbd><kbd>RETURN</kbd></kbd>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
Terminals are usually in canonical mode, where input is read in lines
after it is edited. You may set this into non-canonical mode, where you
set how many characters should be read before input is given to your
program. You also may set the timer in non-canonical mode terminals to
0, this timer flushs your buffer at set intervals. By doing this, you
can use <code>getc()</code> to grab the key pressed immediately by the
user. We use <code>tcgetattr()</code> and <code>tcsetattr()</code> both of which are
defined by POSIX to manipulate the <code>termios</code> structure.

</p>

<pre>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

#include &lt;termios.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

static struct termios stored_settings;

void set_keypress(void)
{
    struct termios new_settings;

    tcgetattr(0,&amp;stored_settings);

    new_settings = stored_settings;

    /* Disable canonical mode, and set buffer size to 1 byte */
    new_settings.c_lflag &amp;= (~ICANON);
    new_settings.c_cc[VTIME] = 0;
    new_settings.c_cc[VMIN] = 1;

    tcsetattr(0,TCSANOW,&amp;new_settings);
    return;
}

void reset_keypress(void)
{
    tcsetattr(0,TCSANOW,&amp;stored_settings);
    return;
}
</pre>



<h2><a name="SEC50" href="index.html#TOC50">3.3 How can I check and see if a key was pressed?</a></h2>


<blockquote>
<p>
How can I check and see if a key was pressed? On DOS I use the
<code>kbhit()</code> function, but there doesn't seem to be an equivalent?
</p></blockquote>

<p>
If you set the terminal to single-character mode (see previous answer),
then (on most systems) you can use <code>select()</code> or <code>poll()</code> to
test for readability.

</p>


<h2><a name="SEC51" href="index.html#TOC51">3.4 How can I move the cursor around the screen?</a></h2>


<blockquote>
<p>
How can I move the cursor around the screen? I want to do full screen
editing without using curses.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
Seriously, you probably <strong>don't</strong> want to do this. Curses knows
about how to handle all sorts of oddities that different terminal types
exhibit; while the termcap/terminfo data will tell you whether any given
terminal type possesses any of these oddities, you will probably find
that correctly handling all the combinations is a <strong>huge</strong> job.

</p>
<p>
However, if you insist on getting your hands dirty (so to speak), look
into the <code>termcap</code> functions, particularly <code>tputs()</code>,
<code>tparm()</code> and <code>tgoto()</code>.

</p>


<h2><a name="SEC52" href="index.html#TOC52">3.5 What are pttys?</a></h2>

<p>
Pseudo-teletypes (pttys, ptys, other variant abbreviations) are
pseudo-devices that have two parts: the <strong>master</strong> side, which can be
thought of as the `user', and the <strong>slave</strong> side, which behaves like a
standard tty device.

</p>
<p>
They exist in order to provide a means to emulate the behaviour of a
serial terminal under the control of a program. For example,
<code>telnet</code> uses a pseudo-terminal on the remote system; the remote
login shell sees the behaviour it expects from a tty device, but the
master side of the pseudo-terminal is being controlled by a daemon that
forwards all data over the network. They are also used by programs such
as <code>xterm</code>, <code>expect</code>, <code>script</code>, <code>screen</code>,
<code>emacs</code>, and many others.

</p>


<h2><a name="SEC53" href="index.html#TOC53">3.6 How to handle a serial port or modem?</a></h2>

<p>
The handling of serial devices under Unix is heavily influenced by the
traditional use of serial terminals. Historically, various combinations
of ioctls and other hacks were necessary to control the precise behaviour
of a serial device, but fortunately this is one of the areas that POSIX
made some efforts to standardise.

</p>
<p>
If you're using a system that doesn't understand <code>&lt;termios.h&gt;</code>,
<code>tcsetattr()</code> and related functions, then you'll have to go
elsewhere for information (or upgrade your system to something less
archaeological).

</p>
<p>
There are still significant differences between systems, however, mainly
in the area of device names, handling of hardware flow control, and
modem signalling. (Whenever possible, leave the device driver to do all
the handshaking work, and don't attempt to manipulate handshaking
signals directly.)

</p>
<p>
The basic steps for opening and initialising a serial device are:

</p>

<ul>
<li>

<code>open()</code> the device; this may require the use of certain flags:

<dl>

<dt><code>O_NONBLOCK</code>
</dt><dd>
Opening a dial-in or modem-controlled device will block until carrier is
present, unless this flag is used. A nonblocking open gives you the
opportunity to disable the modem controls (see CLOCAL below) if
necessary.

</dd><dt><code>O_NOCTTY</code>
</dt><dd>
On 4.4BSD-derived systems this is redundant, but on other systems it
controls whether the serial device can become a control terminal for the
session. In most cases you probably <em>don't</em> want to acquire a
control terminal, and should therefore specify this flag, but there are
exceptions.
</dd></dl>

</li><li>

Use <code>tcgetattr()</code> to retrieve the current device modes. While one
will often ignore most or all of the initial settings thus obtained, it's
still a convenient way of initialising a <code>struct termios</code>.

</li><li>

Set suitable values for <code>c_iflag</code>, <code>c_oflag</code>, <code>c_cflag</code>,
<code>c_lflag</code>, and <code>c_cc</code> in the termios structure. (See below.)

</li><li>

Use <code>cfsetispeed()</code> and <code>cfsetospeed()</code> to set the desired
baud rate. Very few systems allow you to set differing input and output
speeds, so as a general rule you should set both to your desired speed.

</li><li>

Use <code>tcsetattr()</code> to set the device modes.

</li><li>

You may wish, if you used <code>O_NONBLOCK</code> when opening the port, to
use <code>fcntl()</code> to ensure that <code>O_NONBLOCK</code> is turned off again.
Systems seem to differ as to whether a nonblocking open on a tty will
affect subsequent <code>read()</code> calls; better to be explicit.
</li></ul>

<p>
Once you have opened and set up the port, you can then use <code>read()</code>
and <code>write()</code> normally. Note that the behaviour of <code>read()</code> will
be controlled by the flag settings you gave to <code>tcsetattr()</code>.

</p>
<p>
<code>tcflush()</code>, <code>tcdrain()</code>, <code>tcsendbreak()</code> and
<code>tcflow()</code> are additional useful functions that you should be aware
of.

</p>
<p>
When you're done with the port, and want to close it, be aware of a very
nasty little hazard on some systems; if there's any pending output waiting
to be written to the device (e.g. if output flow is stopped by hardware
or software handshaking), your process can hang <strong>unkillably</strong> in the
<code>close()</code> call until the output drains. Calling <code>tcflush()</code> to
discard any pending output is probably a wise move.

</p>
<p>
(Blocked output on tty devices is by far the most common cause of
"unkillable" processes in my experience.)

</p>


<h3><a name="SEC54" href="index.html#TOC54">3.6.1 Serial device names and types</a></h3>

<p>
The device names used for serial port devices vary quite widely between
systems. Some examples from different systems are:

</p>

<ul>
<li>

<tt>`/dev/tty[0-9][a-z]'</tt> for direct access devices, and
<tt>`/dev/tty[0-9][A-Z]'</tt> for modem control devices (e.g. SCO Unix)

</li><li>

<tt>`/dev/cua[0-9]p[0-9]'</tt> for direct access devices,
<tt>`/dev/cul[0-9]p[0-9]'</tt> for dial-out devices and
<tt>`/dev/ttyd[0-9]p[0-9]'</tt> for dial-in devices
(e.g. HP-UX)

</li><li>

<tt>`/dev/cua[a-z][0-9]'</tt> for dial-out devices and
<tt>`/dev/tty[a-z][0-9]'</tt> for dial-in devices (e.g. FreeBSD)
</li></ul>

<p>
The precise interaction between the device name used, and the effect on
any hardware handshake lines is system-, configuration- and
hardware-dependant, but will usually follow approximately these rules
(assuming that the hardware is RS-232 DTE):

</p>

<ul>
<li>

A successful open of any device should assert DTR and RTS

</li><li>

A blocking open of a modem-control or dial-in device will wait for
DCD (and possibly also DSR and/or CTS) to be raised, usually after
asserting DTR/RTS.

</li><li>

An open of a dial-out device while an open call to the corresponding
dial-in device is blocked waiting for carrier <em>may or may not</em>
cause the open of the dial-in port to complete. Some systems implement a
simple sharing scheme for dial-in and dial-out ports whereby the dial-in
port is effectively "put to sleep" while the dial-out port is in use;
other systems do not do this, and sharing the port between dial-in and
dial-out on such systems requires external cooperation (e.g. use of UUCP
lockfiles) to avoid contention problems.
</li></ul>



<h3><a name="SEC55" href="index.html#TOC55">3.6.2 Setting up termios flags</a></h3>

<p>
Some hints on setting up the termios flags when using a serial device
that you've opened yourself (as opposed to using your existing control
tty):

</p>


<h4><a name="SEC56" href="index.html#TOC56">3.6.2.1 c_iflag</a></h4>

<p>
You probably want to set <strong>all</strong> the bits in <code>c_iflag</code> to 0,
unless you want to use software flow control (ick) in which case you set
<code>IXON</code> and <code>IXOFF</code>.

</p>


<h4><a name="SEC57" href="index.html#TOC57">3.6.2.2 c_oflag</a></h4>

<p>
Most of the bits of <code>c_oflag</code> are hacks of one sort or another to
make output to slow terminals work, and as such some newer systems have
dropped almost all of them as obsolete (especially all the gory
output-padding options). As with <code>c_iflag</code>, setting everything to 0
is reasonable for most applications.

</p>


<h4><a name="SEC58" href="index.html#TOC58">3.6.2.3 c_cflag</a></h4>

<p>
When setting the character size, remember to mask using <code>CSIZE</code>
first; e.g. to set 8-bit characters, use:

</p><pre>    attr.c_cflag &amp;= ~CSIZE;
    attr.c_cflag |= CS8;
</pre>

<p>
Other important flags found in <code>c_cflag</code> that you probably want to
turn <strong>on</strong> and <code>CREAD</code> and <code>HUPCL</code>.

</p>
<p>
If you need to generate even parity, then set <code>PARENB</code> and clear
<code>PARODD</code>; if you need to generate odd parity then set both
<code>PARENB</code> and <code>PARODD</code>. If you don't want parity at all, then
make sure <code>PARENB</code> is clear.

</p>
<p>
Clear <code>CSTOPB</code> unless you actually need to generate two stop bits.

</p>
<p>
Flags for enabling hardware flow control may also be found in
<code>c_cflag</code>, but they aren't standardised (pity).

</p>


<h4><a name="SEC59" href="index.html#TOC59">3.6.2.4 c_lflag</a></h4>

<p>
Most applications will probably want to turn off <code>ICANON</code>
(canonical, i.e. line-based, input processing), <code>ECHO</code>, and
<code>ISIG</code>.

</p>
<p>
<code>IEXTEN</code> is a more complex issue. If you don't turn it off, the
implementation is allowed to do nonstandard things (like define
additional control characters in <code>c_cc</code>) that might cause
unexpected results, but you might need to leave <code>IEXTEN</code> enabled
on some systems to get useful features like hardware flow control.

</p>


<h4><a name="SEC60" href="index.html#TOC60">3.6.2.5 c_cc</a></h4>

<p>
This is an array of characters that have special meanings on input.
These characters are given names like <code>VINTR</code>, <code>VSTOP</code> etc.;
the names are indexes into the array.

</p>
<p>
(Two of these "characters" are not really characters at all, but control
the behaviour of <code>read()</code> when <code>ICANON</code> is disabled; these are
<code>VMIN</code> and <code>VTIME</code>.)

</p>
<p>
The indexes are often referred to as though they were actual variables,
e.g. "set VMIN to 1" actually means "set c_cc[VMIN] to 1". The shorthand
is useful and only occasionally confusing.

</p>
<p>
Many of the slots in <code>c_cc</code> are only used if some other combination
of flags is set:

</p>
<dl>

<dt>Used only if <code>ICANON</code> is set
</dt><dd>
<code>VEOF</code>, <code>VEOL</code>, <code>VERASE</code>, <code>VKILL</code> (and also
<code>VEOL2</code>, <code>VSTATUS</code> and <code>VWERASE</code> if defined and
<code>IEXTEN</code> is set)

</dd><dt>Used only if <code>ISIG</code> is set
</dt><dd>
<code>VINTR</code>, <code>VQUIT</code>, <code>VSUSP</code> (and also <code>VDSUSP</code> if
defined and <code>IEXTEN</code> is set)

</dd><dt>Used only if <code>IXON</code> or <code>IXOFF</code> is set
</dt><dd>
<code>VSTOP</code>, <code>VSTART</code>

</dd><dt>Used only if <code>ICANON</code> is <strong>not</strong> set
</dt><dd>
<code>VMIN</code>, <code>VTIME</code>
</dd></dl>

<p>
Implementations may define additional entries in <code>c_cc</code>. It may
be prudent to initialise all the entries to <code>_POSIX_VDISABLE</code>
(the constant <code>NCCS</code> gives the array size) before setting the
specific values you wish to use.

</p>
<p>
<code>VMIN</code> and <code>VTIME</code> (which may share slots with <code>VEOF</code> and
<code>VEOL</code> respectively, depending on the implementation) have the
following meaning. The value of <code>VTIME</code> is (if not 0) always
interpreted as a timer in tenths of seconds.

</p>
<dl>

<dt><code>c_cc[VMIN] &gt; 0, c_cc[VTIME] &gt; 0</code>
</dt><dd>
<code>read()</code> will return when either VMIN bytes of input are available,
or if at least one character has been read and VTIME has expired between
characters, or if interrupted by a signal.

</dd><dt><code>c_cc[VMIN] &gt; 0, c_cc[VTIME] == 0</code>
</dt><dd>
<code>read()</code> will return when VMIN bytes of input are available, or if
interrupted. Otherwise it will wait indefinitely.

</dd><dt><code>c_cc[VMIN] == 0, c_cc[VTIME] &gt; 0</code>
</dt><dd>
<code>read()</code> will return as soon as any input is available; if VTIME
expires with no data arriving, it will return with no characters read.
(This conflicts slightly with the end-of-file indication received in
the event of modem hangup; using 1 for VMIN and either <code>alarm()</code>
or <code>select()</code> for a timeout avoids this particular problem.)

</dd><dt><code>c_cc[VMIN] == 0, c_cc[VTIME] == 0</code>
</dt><dd>
<code>read()</code> will always return immediately; if no data is available
it will return with no characters read (with the same problem as above).
</dd></dl>
