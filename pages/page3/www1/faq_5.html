<h2><a name="SEC62" href="index.html#TOC62">4.1 How can I tell how much memory my system has?</a></h2>

<p>
This is another `Frequently Unanswered Question'. In most cases, you
should not even <em>attempt</em> to find out.

</p>
<p>
If you really must, then it can usually be done, but in a highly
system-dependent fashion. For example, on Solaris, you can use
<code>sysconf(_SC_PHYS_PAGES)</code> and <code>sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE)</code>; on
FreeBSD, you can use <code>sysctl()</code>; on Linux you can read and parse
<tt>`/proc/meminfo'</tt> (being careful to allow any of the historically
valid formats for this file); other systems may have their own methods.
I'm not aware of any more portable methods.

</p>
<p>
For HP-UX (9 and 10), the following code has been contributed:

</p>

<pre>struct pst_static pst;

if (pstat_getstatic(&amp;pst, sizeof(pst), (size_t) 1, 0) != -1)
{
    printf(" Page Size: %lu\n", pst.page_size);
    printf("Phys Pages: %lu\n", pst.physical_memory);
}
</pre>



<h2><a name="SEC63" href="index.html#TOC63">4.2 How do I check a user's password?</a></h2>



<h3><a name="SEC64" href="index.html#TOC64">4.2.1 How do I get a user's password?</a></h3>

<p>
Traditionally user passwords were kept in the <tt>`/etc/passwd'</tt> file,
on most UNIX flavours. Which is usually of this format:

</p>
<p>
username:password:uid:gid:gecos field:home directory:login shell

</p>
<p>
Though this has changed with time, now user information may be kept on
other hosts, or not necessarily in the <tt>`/etc/passwd'</tt> file.  Modern
implementations also made use of `shadow' password files which hold the
password, along with sensitive information.  This file would be readable
only by privileged users.

</p>
<p>
The password is usually not in clear text, but encrypted due to security
concerns.

</p>
<p>
POSIX defines a suite of routines which can be used to access this
database for queries. The quickest way to get an individual record for a
user is with the <code>getpwnam()</code> and <code>getpwuid()</code> routines. Both
return a pointer to a struct passwd, which holds the users information
in various members. <code>getpwnam()</code> accepts a string holding the
user's name, <code>getpwuid()</code> accepts a uid (type <code>uid_t</code> as
defined by POSIX). Both return NULL if they fail.

</p>
<p>
However, as explained earlier, a shadow database exists on most modern
systems to hold sensitive information, namely the password. Some systems
only return the password if the calling uid is of the superuser, others
require you to use another suite of functions for the shadow password
database. If this is the case you need to make use of <code>getspnam()</code>,
which accepts a username and returns a struct spwd. Again, in order to
successfully do this, you will need to have privileges. (On some systems,
notably HP-UX and SCO, you may need to use <code>getprpwnam()</code> instead.)

</p>


<h3><a name="SEC65" href="index.html#TOC65">4.2.2 How do I get shadow passwords by uid?</a></h3>


<blockquote>
<p>
My system uses the getsp* suite of routines to get the sensitive user
information. However I do not have <code>getspuid()</code>, only
<code>getspnam()</code>. How do I work around this, and get by uid?
</p></blockquote>

<p>
The work around is relatively painless. The following routine should go
straight into your personal utility library:

</p>

<pre>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

#include &lt;pwd.h&gt;
#include &lt;shadow.h&gt;

struct spwd *getspuid(uid_t pw_uid)
{
  struct spwd *shadow;
  struct passwd *ppasswd;

  if( ((ppasswd = getpwuid(pw_uid)) == NULL) 
      || ((shadow = getspnam(ppasswd-&gt;pw_name)) == NULL))
    return NULL;
  
  return shadow;
}
</pre>

<p>
The problem is, that some systems do not keep the uid, or other
information in the shadow database.

</p>


<h3><a name="SEC66" href="index.html#TOC66">4.2.3 How do I verify a user's password?</a></h3>

<p>
The fundamental problem here is, that various authentication systems
exist, and passwords aren't always what they seem. Also with the
traditional one way encryption method used by most UNIX flavours (out of
the box), the encryption algorithm may differ, some systems use a one
way DES encryption, others like the international release of FreeBSD use
MD5.

</p>
<p>
The most popular way is to have a one way encryption algorithm, where
the password cannot be decrypted. Instead the password is taken in clear
text from input, and encrypted and checked against the encrypted
password in the database. The details of how to encrypt should really
come from your man page for <code>crypt()</code>, but here's a usual version:

</p>

<pre>/* given a plaintext password and an encrypted password, check if
 * they match; returns 1 if they match, 0 otherwise.
 */

int check_pass(const char *plainpw, const char *cryptpw)
{
    return strcmp(crypt(plainpw,cryptpw), cryptpw) == 0;
}
</pre>

<p>
This works because the salt used in encrypting the password is stored as
an initial substring of the encrypted value.

</p>
<p>
<em>WARNING:</em> on some systems, password encryption is actually done
with a variant of crypt called <code>bigcrypt()</code>.
